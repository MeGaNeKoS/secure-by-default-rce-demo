# Python Requirements

To install the Python dependencies, navigate to the `exploit/` directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Go Binary

The Go exploit `hello.go` is designed to be cross-compiled for Linux. To build the binary, navigate to the `exploit/` directory and run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p dist
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/hello-linux-amd64 hello.go
```

This will create an executable file named `hello-linux-amd64` in the `exploit/dist/` directory, which is used by `poc_advanced.py`.
