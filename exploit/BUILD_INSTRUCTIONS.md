# Python Dependencies

To install the necessary Python dependencies, first navigate to the `exploit/` directory. Then, execute the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Go Binary

The `hello.go` program is a Go exploit that can be compiled for different operating systems. It is used by `poc_advanced.py`.

To build the executable, navigate to the `exploit/` directory and follow the instructions below based on your target operating system:

## Building for Linux (64-bit)

This will produce a Linux executable compatible with `poc_advanced.py`.

```bash
mkdir -p dist
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/hello-linux-amd64 hello.go
```

## Building for Windows (64-bit)

This will produce a Windows executable.

```bash
mkdir -p dist
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/hello-windows-amd64.exe hello.go
```

The compiled binaries will be placed in the `exploit/dist/` directory.
